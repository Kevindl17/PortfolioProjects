# Portfolio Projects

All of these folders are different Python programs that I have written since August 2022. 
Feel free to navigate the different folders and check out the code that I have written. There are also individual README files for every single program!
### <ins> Facility Address Project </ins>
- As part of my internship, I created a Python program that used the Google Maps Api to find the addresses of more than 5000 sports facilities throughout the US. The company agreed that it would be impossible to find the addresses with a 100% accuracy and was only looking to get the addresses to have a rough estimate of where all their facilities were located.
### <ins> Card Guesser Game </ins>
- This Python code is a simple card guesser game. The game starts off by asking the user which suit the card is, and tells the user when it is a correct guess or if the guess is wrong. After the suit has been guessed correctly, the program asks the user to input which number is on the card. This program also has a database connected to it that saves the personal record of fewest guesses and the number of times the game has been played. When the user starts the game, it shows the number of times played and also the fewest guesses.
### <ins> Date Calculator </ins>
- This Python code is a simple Date Calculator. This calculator gives the user two options; calculate how many days are between the user's birthday and Christmas, and to calculate how many days there are between two user entered dates.
### <ins> Hex, Bin, Byte Calculator </ins>
- This Python code is a simple hex, bin, byte calculator. The calculator starts off by asking the user if they want to: Convert a string to hex or binary, or if they want to convert an integer to bytes. Depending on the choice of the user, the program will ask for a string or an integer and then convert them to the requested type.
### <ins> JSON Creator </ins>
- This Python code is a simple JSON file creator. The CreateJSON program allows the user to create an employee JSON file that stores information on employee's name, team, role, and salary.
### <ins> JSON Reader </ins>
- This Python code is a simple JSON Reader. The LoadJSON program allows the user to open an employee JSON file that stores information on employee's name, team, role, and salary. This program also gives the user the option to retrieve employee information by inputting the employee number of that person.
### <ins> Premier League Matchday 4 Goal Calculator </ins>
- This Python code is a simple Premier League Matchday 4 Goal Calculator. This program creates and loads a CSV file with the match results between all the matches played during matchday 4 of the English Premier League (soccer). It then asks the user if they want to: Pick two times and see how many goals were scored between these two intervals, or input a single time and see how many goals were scored after this minute.
### <ins> Retrieve Stock Data From Database </ins>
- This simple Python program is able to retrieve stock data from a database. The program creates an sqlite database and stores 11 rows of stock data into this database. The data stored in the database is: symbol, price, percentage change, market cap, industry, and trading volume. The purpose of this code is to showcase that I know how to insert and retreive data from a database. Since the database is created upon running this code, the stock data is not up to date, this can be fixed by adding lines of code that will actually scrape live stock data, which will be part of a future project.
### <ins> Current Stock Scraper</ins>
- This Python code is a simple stock web scraper. This program starts by asking the user for one or multiple symbols, then the program goes to the marketwatch website and scrapes the stock name, stock price, marketcap, and the pe ratio from this website. 
### <ins> Historic Stock Scraper</ins>
- This Python code is a simple stock web scraper that aims to retrieve the stock's past performance results. The program starts by asking the user for one or multiple symbols, and how many past days of data they want to see. Then the program goes to the finance.yahoo website and scrapes the stock name, date, open price, close price, and the current stock price from this website.
**This program might take a couple of seconds to run if you try to retrieve data from a lot of days, or add a lot of symbols.
