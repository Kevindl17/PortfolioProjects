# Portfolio Projects

All of these folders are different Python programs that I have written since August 2022. 
Feel free to navigate the different folders and check out the code that I have written. There are also individual README files for every single program!
### <ins> Card Guesser Game </ins>
- This Python code is a simple card guesser game. The game starts off by asking the user which suit the card is, and tells the user when it is a correct guess or if the guess is wrong. After the suit has been guessed correctly, the program asks the user to input which number is on the card. This program also has a database connected to it that saves the personal record of fewest guesses and the number of times the game has been played. When the user starts the game, it shows the number of times played and also the fewest guesses.
### <ins> Date Calculator </ins>
- This Python code is a simple Date Calculator. This calculator gives the user two options; calculate how many days are between the user's birthday and Christmas, and to calculate how many days there are between two user entered dates.
### <ins> Hex, Bin, Byte Calculator </ins>
- This Python code is a simple hex, bin, byte calculator. The calculator starts off by asking the user if they want to: Convert a string to hex or binary, or if they want to convert an integer to bytes. Depending on the choice of the user, the program will ask for a string or an integer and then convert them to the requested type.
### <ins> JSON Creator </ins>
- This Python code is a simple JSON file creator. The CreateJSON program allows the user to create an employee JSON file that stores information on employee's name, team, role, and salary.
### <ins> JSON Reader </ins>
- This Python code is a simple JSON Reader. The LoadJSON program allows the user to open an employee JSON file that stores information on employee's name, team, role, and salary. This program also gives the user the option to retrieve employee information by inputting the employee number of that person.
