The \"Equipment\" category is not balanced compared to these 4 categories since it has 110 more repeat purchases than the second highest category, which is \"Food\". \"Accessory\" and the \"Unknown\" category are also more than 100 repeat purchases below the lowest of the 4 categories, which shows that the scores for these categories are not balanced either.

ALso, we can see that the mode falls between the values of 1001 - 1100 dollars, with several outliers being present that have values above 2200 dollars. We can also see that there are no sales with a value lower than 200 dollars, so there are no real outliers on the lower part. "

    "As we can see in the visualization below, the interquartile ranges of both repeat purchases and no repeat purchases overlap, this shows that there is a high similarity between the two box plots and not much difference. The median of no repeat purchases lies a little higher than the median of repeat purchases, but since the median of no repeat purchases is still in between the interquartile range of repeat purchases there is not much of a difference here either. When looking at the whiskers of both box plots, we can see that the range of no repeat purchases is larger than the range of repeat purchases. The fact that the interquartile ranges overlap so much and that the median's are close together and still within the other category's interquartile range, this shows that whether the purchases is a repeat or non repeat purchase does not have a big influence on sales.
