## Sales Data SQL Project
The SQL file in this project is a simple analysis of a sample sales dataset. When I first downloaded this salesdata from Kaggle, I used Excel to do datacleaning and to split the data up into two tables: the sales table, and the customer table. Once the cleaning was done, I imported the two cvs files into MySQL and started writing SQL code. My main goal was to query data from these datatables, which in a later project could be turned into Tableau graphs.
