# Historic Stock Scraper
This Python code is a simple stock web scraper that aims to retrieve the stock's past performance results. The program starts by asking the user for one or multiple symbols, and how many past days of data they want to see. Then the program goes to the finance.yahoo website and scrapes the stock name, date, open price, close price, and the current stock price from this website.
**This program might take a couple of seconds to run if you try to retrieve data from a lot of days, or add a lot of symbols.
