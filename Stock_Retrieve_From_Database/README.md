# Retrieve Stock Data From Database
This simple Python program is able to retrieve stock data from a database. The program creates an sqlite database and stores 11 rows of stock data into this database. The data stored in the database is: symbol, price, percentage change, market cap, industry, and trading volume. The purpose of this code is to showcase that I know how to insert and retreive data from a database. Since the database is created upon running this code, the stock data is not up to date, this can be fixed by adding lines of code that will actually scrape live stock data, which will be part of a future project.
