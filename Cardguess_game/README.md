# Card Guesser Game
This Python code is a simple card guesser game. The game starts off by asking the user which suit the card is, and tells the user when it is a correct guess or if the guess is wrong. After the suit has been guessed correctly, the program asks the user to input which number is on the card. This program also has a database connected to it that saves the personal record of fewest guesses and the number of times the game has been played. When the user starts the game, it shows the number of times played and also the fewest guesses.
